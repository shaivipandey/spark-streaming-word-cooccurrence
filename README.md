# spark-streaming-word-cooccurrence
Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for Assignment #4 of the CSE 4/587 Data Intensive Computing course at the University at Buffalo. The assignment covers Spark Streaming, word co-occurrence analysis, and understanding biases in data, offering hands-on experience with distributed streaming data processing.

Contents
1. Word Co-occurrence Program: Implementation of a real-time word co-occurrence algorithm using Spark Streaming, with input data streamed through a TCP socket.
2. Comprehensive Report on DStream: A detailed review of the paper "Discretized Streams: Fault-Tolerant Streaming Computation at Scale."
3. Bias Analysis: Identification and analysis of biases in various scenarios, providing potential solutions to mitigate these biases.
